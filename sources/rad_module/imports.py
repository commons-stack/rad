# TO DO: Implement.

# def load_sources_from_json(path):
# This method will contain the logic to load all reward objects specified in a JSON file and return them as an array for further processing. A big part of the implmentation already exists in main.py

# def load_dist_conf_from_json(path):
# This method will contain the logic to load the necessary configuration paramaters to perform a distribution over an existing rewards object. A big part of the implementation already exists in main.py, although furher development on the praiseDistribtion class will probably be necessary.

# def load_exports_from_json(path):
# This method will contain the logic to load the necessary configuration to execte all the exports from an existing distribution object. A part of the implmentation already exists in main.py
